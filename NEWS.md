FeatureExtraction 3.1.1
=======================

Bugfixes:

1. Correct output of multiple cohort IDs in `print()` function.

2. Fixing duplicates in counts when generating server-side aggregated measurement-range-group covariates.


FeatureExtraction 3.1.0
=======================

Changes:

1. Added ability to compute aggregated statistics for multiple cohorts at once: The `cohortId` argument of the `getDbCovariateData()` function now accepts a vector of IDs. The aggregated statistics now contains a new field called `cohortDefinitionId` that can be used to distinguish between the various cohorts.

2. Added `filterByCohortDefinitionId()` function to select covariates of one cohort from a `covariateData` object containing multiple.

3. The `cohortId` argument now also supports integers greater than 32-bits.

Bugfixes:

1. If a person has multiple measurements with the same `measurement_concept_id`, the selection of which measurement value to include is now deterministic.


FeatureExtraction 3.0.1
=======================

Changes:

1. Adding timeRef table to CovariateData object for temporal covariates.

2. Throw meaningful error when `createCovariateSettings()` is called without specifying any covariates.

3. `getDbCovariateData()` returns empty covariates instead of NULL covariates when no covariates are specified. 

Bugfixes: 

1. Time ID is now retrieved when aggregating binary temporal covariates.


FeatureExtraction 3.0.0
=======================

Changes:

1. Switching from ff to Andromeda for storage of large data objects.

2. Adding option to createTable1 to (also) show absolute counts.

3. For analyses that restrict to inpatient diagnoses, the string '(inpatient)' is now appended to the covariate name.

Bugfixes: 

1. Dropping spurious 'analysis_name' field in temporary covariate reference table.

2. Fixed covariate name of age groups over 100 years old. 


FeatureExtraction 2.2.5
=======================

Changes:

1. Added Korean translation of vignettes.

Bugfixes:

1. Fixing aggregation of covariates generated using the cohort_attribute table.

2. Fixed error when calling tidyCovariates without removing redundancy, when there are no infrequent covariates.

3. Fixed server-side computation of median and interquartile range for measurement values.

4. Restricting by concept ID now works for measurement values.

FeatureExtraction 2.2.4
=======================

Bugfixes:

1. Removing redundant covariates now precedes removing infrequent covariates when calling tidyCovariates. Analyses where the most prevalent (redundant) covariate was removed are now exempt from removal of infrequent covariates.

2. Fixed some typos in the vignette


FeatureExtraction 2.2.3
=======================

Changes:

1. Also removing descendants when excluding condition concepts from condition groups. Condition groups therefore now work similar to drug groups.

Bugfixes:

1. Updated workaround for ff bug causing chunk.default error on R v3.6.0 on machines with lots of memory.


FeatureExtraction 2.2.2
=======================

Changes:

1. Using new SqlRender (v1.6.0) functions.


FeatureExtraction 2.2.1
=======================

Changes:

1. Added option to specify number of digits for continuous variables in createTable1 function.

Bugfixes:

1. Added missing space cause SQL error when both include and exclude concept are specified.


FeatureExtraction 2.2.0
=======================

Changes:

1. Added the Hospital Frailty Risk Score.
