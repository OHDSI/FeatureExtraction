\title{Compute standardized difference of mean for all covariates.}
\usage{
computeStandardizedDifference(
  covariateData1,
  covariateData2,
  cohortId1 = NULL,
  cohortId2 = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{covariateData1}{The covariate data of the first cohort. Needs to be in aggregated format.}

\item{covariateData2}{The covariate data of the second cohort. Needs to be in aggregated format.}

\item{cohortId1}{If provided, \code{covariateData1} will be restricted to this cohort. If not
provided, \code{covariateData1} is assumed to contain data on only 1 cohort.}

\item{cohortId2}{If provided, \code{covariateData2} will be restricted to this cohort. If not
provided, \code{covariateData2} is assumed to contain data on only 1 cohort.}
}
\value{
A data frame with means and standard deviations per cohort as well as the standardized difference
of mean.
}
\description{
Computes the standardized difference for all covariates between two cohorts. The standardized
difference is defined as the difference between the mean divided by the overall standard deviation.
