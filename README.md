FeatureExtraction is part of [HADES](https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades).

Introduction
============
An R package for generating features (covariates) for a cohort using data in the Common Data Model.

Features
========
- Takes a cohort as input.
- Generates baseline features for that cohort.
- Default covariates include all drugs, diagnoses, procedures, as well as age, comorbidity indexes, etc.
- Support for creating custom covariates.
- Generate paper-ready summary table of select population characteristics.

Technology
==========
FeatureExtraction is an R package, with some functions implemented in C++.

System Requirements
===================
Requires R (version 3.2.2 or higher). Installation on Windows requires [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). FeatureExtraction require Java.

Getting Started
===============
1. See the instructions [here](https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades/rSetup.html) for configuring your R environment, including RTools and Java.

3. In R, use the following commands to download and install FeatureExtraction:
